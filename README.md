# Text-Based-Adventure-Game

The first large project I ever done. 

Developed in BlueJ. In hindsight there is alot of ways I could improve this project, but it served as a good tool to teach me about things like encapsulation, inherintence, polymorphism and abstraction. The project also taught me how to build a project when given minimal requirements.
